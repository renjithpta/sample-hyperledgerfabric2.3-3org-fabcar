# ACRIS Schema

The data model for Flight Chain is based on ACI ACRIS json data. This folder contains the schema file and the
typescript interface generated from this.
 

## Regenerating the schema files

This schema file was generated by running the file

`../../node_modules/.bin/json2ts --input ACRISFlight.schema.json --output ACRISFlight.ts`

And then the interfaces were converted to classes & `@ApiModelProperty` added.

It depends on this [] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-typescript) NPM package.

The ACRIS Schema files were originally developed by ACI.
